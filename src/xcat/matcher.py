"""Ignore matching utilities for xcat.

This module decides whether a file or directory should be skipped.

It is responsible for matching paths against ignore patterns, including
plain names, relative paths, glob-style patterns, and eventually richer
ignore semantics.

It should not walk directories or read file contents.
